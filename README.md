# 100DaysofRTL
## System-Verilog
SystemVerilog language is used to model, design, simulate, test and implement electronic system. It is the most preferred language for the IP & Sub-system verification that demands constrained random verification. Also, it's an IEEE standard Hardware Design and Verification Language [HDVL] which can be used for both the RTL design and verification.
